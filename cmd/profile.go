	To view the profile of a deck:
	profile -d <deck_id>
	
	To view the profile of a game:
	profile --game <game_id>
	
	To view your own profile:
	profile
	
	To edit your own profile:
	profile -e <field> <value>`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// profileCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// profileCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
