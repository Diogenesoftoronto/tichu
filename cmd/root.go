	Each player is dealt 14 cards, and 
	the remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table.

	The object of the game is to win tricks containing cards of higher 
	value than those played by the other players.
	Each trick is won by the player who played the highest-ranking card of the suit led.

	Players may also play special cards called Tichus or Grand Tichus 
	to win tricks without playing the highest card.

	At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.

	Points are awarded for winning tricks and for 
	holding certain cards in hand at the end of the game.`,
