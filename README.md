# Tichu
Tichu is a card game. This is a game written in go for playing tichu on the command line! ðŸŽ‡ ðŸ€„
## Description

It is played with a standard 52-card deck, plus 4 jokers.
Each player is dealt 14 cards, and the remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the table.
The object of the game is to win tricks containing cards of higher value than those played by the other players.
Each trick is won by the player who played the highest-ranking card of the suit led.
Players may also play special cards called Tichus or Grand Tichus to win tricks without playing the highest card.
At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.
Points are awarded for winning tricks and for holding certain cards in hand at the end of the game.

## Rules

The rules of tichu are a bit complex but can be found [here](TICHU_RULES.md).

## Motivation

I wanted to create a game with Go and the Bubbletea library for my friends to play if they wanted.
I also wanted to try seeing if I could use this commandline tool in a larger project I am working on with GDscript and [Godot](https://www.godotengine.org).
This is also my first time using the Bubbletea library so I wanted to see how it worked in a smaller project.
